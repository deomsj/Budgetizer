# Budgetizer

## Application Summary

This is a simple budgeting application to help users track theyâ€™re spending.

## Functionality

The application will be able to:

- create and manage data for multiple users
- display transactions in a table
- add transactions
- sort tabular transaction data
- persist transactions across browser sessions
- delete transactions
- edit transactions
- meaningful graphical display of transactions
- bulk upload transactions from a csv file
- download transactions data to csv
- filter tabular transaction data

Note: All user data is simply stored in the browser's local storage. Do not store any sensitive information in this app unless you wire up this user interface to a secure data storage strategy with proper authentication

## Data Models

{
  id: Number, // time in ms that can be used to generate date
  user_id: String,
  description: String,
  merchant: String,

  amount: String
}
```

### Users

```javascript
{
  id: String,
  dob: String,
  firstName: String,
  lastName: String,
  transactions: [String] // array of transaction ids
